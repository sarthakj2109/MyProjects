Greetings to all the Wonderful coders out there!
This is my class 10th Board Examinations Project,
Please do run the code and get a chance to experience Online Railway Ticket Booking procedure (as in www.indianrail.gov.in) in a completely offline mode!!
This can serve as a mock booking (practice) for people who are unaware of what railway ticket reservation feels like..

PROJECT TITLE: RAILWAY RESERVATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
